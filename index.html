The Migrant Social Protection Data Set (MigSP) provides comparative data on immigrant welfare rights for 39 countries in Western and Eastern Europe, Latin America, North America, Oceania, and Southeast Asia for the years 1980-2018. 
The data set covers the welfare rights of different legal categories, namely temporary and permanent labor migrants, asylum seekers, recognized refugees and family reunification migrants. It contains indicators on both direct and indirect ways of restricting access. 
The data was collected within Project B04 of the Collaborative Research Center "Global Dynamics of Social Policy" (CRC 1342) at the University of Bremen. The project is led by Dr. Friederike RÃ¶mer. The CRC is funded by the German Research Foundation until 2025. The dataset builds on items developed within the project Immigration Policies In Comparison (IMPIC).
