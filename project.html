<h2> Migrant Social Protection </h2>
</p>

The project investigates variations in immigrant welfare rights, i.e. how they evolve over time, and how they differ between countries. 

MigSP offers a new set of quantitative comparative measures of de jure immigrant welfare rights in regard to unemployment insurance and social assistance benefits covering 39 countries in Europe, Latin America, North America, Oceania and Southeast Asia for the years 1980-2018. 

The data set covers the welfare rights of labor migrants, asylum seekers and recognized refugees. It contains indicators on access to social assistance and unemployment insurance as well as on the consequences of welfare benefit receipt and indirect measures preventing access to the benefits.

#### Next Steps

The project aims to further develop the MigSP data set using further funding via the Collaborative Research Centre "Global Dynamics of Social Policy" at the University of Bremen. In addition to social assistance and unemployment insurance, the data set will cover non-contributory child benefits, non-contributory old-age pensions and employment injury insurance in order to gain a more comprehensive vision of immigrant welfare rights. We also extend the data set to the years 2019 to 2021.
