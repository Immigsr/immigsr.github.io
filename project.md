#### Immigrant Welfare Rights

The Migrant Social Protection Dataset provides data on immigrant welfare rights defined as "the legal rights of immigrants to access the array of benefits and services that the welfare state in the country of residence offers to its citizens" (REF Launch Paper). 

At the heart of our conceptualization lies the argument that the term "immigrant welfare rights" encompasses a variety of direct and indirect restrictions for different groups of immigrants across an array of different benefit and services. Immigrant welfare rights therefore are a multi-dimensional construct: (1) First, rights differ by the legal category of immigrant that is considered. (2) Second, rights differ across welfare benefit schemes. (3) Third, restrictions in immigrant welfare rights might occur through direct or indirect measures.

#### Methodology 
   
MigSP builds on a methodology and set of questions that was developed in the realm of the 
<a href="[url](http://www.impic-project.eu/)">Immigration Policies in Comparison (IMPIC) project</a>. It uses a standardized questionnaire and works with legal experts to extract qualitative information from legal texts. The experts are sent an online questionnaire which contains both closed and open questions. The questionnaire is designed in such a way as to minimize the influence of subjective evaluations of restrictions of immigrant welfare rights. The qualitative data is then scored independently by a team of researchers to produce numerical country-year indicators.

#### Next Steps

The project aims to further develop the MigSP data set with the help of funding by the German Research Foundation (DFG) via the Collaborative Research Centre "Global Dynamics of Social Policy" at the University of Bremen. In addition to social assistance and unemployment insurance, the data set will cover non-contributory child benefits, non-contributory old-age pensions and employment injury insurance in order to gain a more comprehensive vision of immigrant welfare rights. The temporal coverage will also be extended to the years 2019 to 2021 and eight additional countries will be included.
